Telegram Bot SDK
================

An unofficial Kotlin Multiplatform implementation of the Telegram SDK.

## Incomplete / Experimental
This library works, however it is far from complete and not actively being
worked on, and was built out for a relatively simple purpose.
If a feature/endpoint is missing, feel free to contribute a PR to help
build out this project.

## Installation

The library is published to Maven Central and the client can be installed with:

    implementation("com.inkapplications.telegram:client:+") // replace version with latest
